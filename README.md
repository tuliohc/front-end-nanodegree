# Memory Game Project

The project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project, provided by Udacity (https://github.com/udacity/fend-project-memory-game). This project was converted from a static project to an interactive one. It's part of the last project of Udacity Nanodegree Web Front-end Fundamentals.

## Initialize the game

To start the game, you should open the following file:

```
index.html
```

When you select the first card, a timer will start to count.

## Game rules

- A player must turn a card to reveal his symbol
- Then, that same player must turn another card, trying to find the corresponding one.
- If the cards are the same, both face up
- If the cards are not equal, both cards must face down again
- After match all cards, the score board will show your performance (time, moves counter and stars). 
- If you do less than 11 moves to finish the game, you should have 3 stars on your score board.
- If you have between 11 and 15 moves, you should have 2 starts on your score board.
- If you have more than 15 moves, you should have at least 1 star on your score board.
